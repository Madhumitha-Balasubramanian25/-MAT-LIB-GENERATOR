# MAT-LIB-GENERATOR
By Using Python

Have you heared about “matlib”?

“MadLibs” is a game where we write a story with missing words, then ask friends or family members to fill in the blanks. But they don’t know what your story’s about, the result is often wonderful.

Traditional MadLibs are done with paper and ink. But now that we’re in the digital age, we can recreate the game with some simple Python code, and reuse each MadLib over and over.
